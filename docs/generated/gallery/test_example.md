A short Python script
=====================

This demonstrates an example `.py` file that is not executed when gallery is
generated (see
[Parsing and executing examples via matching patterns](https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/configuration.html#build-pattern))
but nevertheless gets included as an example. Note that no output is captured as this file is not executed.
