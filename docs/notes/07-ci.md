# Continuous integration

- readthedocs will handle docs building.
- Jenkins with Flatiron cluster for any tests requiring GPUs or more time/resources than can be obtained through Github actions.
- Github actions for everything else (see [here](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources)) for resources):
  - use `matrix` to test on multiple python versions and OSs.
  - `pytest tests/`, see [here](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.3.x/)
  - that all notebooks can run (only done on github actions if using `.ipynb` files, but done by readthedocs for mkdocs-gallery)
    - for notebooks that take too long to run on runners, use [papermill](https://papermill.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage-parameterize.html) to parametrize them to reduce runtime
  - running linters with `tox`
  - generating test coverage report: `coveralls`. any PR must maintain or increase coverage in order to be merged.
  - use [alls-green](https://github.com/re-actors/alls-green) or similar ot check that all tests ran successfully (so only have a single check for branch protection rule)
  - think about how frequently to run tests. one good possibility: weekly, manually, and on every PR:
  ```
  on:
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
  - cron: 0 0 * * 0     # weekly
  pull_request:
    branches:
    - main
    - development
  ```
  - trigger the .github/workflow/connect.yml github action for debuging, it will allow you to ssh connect to the runner
  - deploy to `pypi` on release (test using `test.pypi.org`, test installation and tests run, then deploy)
