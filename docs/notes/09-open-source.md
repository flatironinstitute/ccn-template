# Open source / community stuff

Every package should:
- have a `CONTRIBUTING.md`, what kind of contributions are expected, how to write tests, etc.
- have a code of conduct. [contributor covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is a good starting point.
- clear explanation of how to interact with maintainers and ask questions, e.g., use Github discussion or other forum to ask usage questions, open an issue for bugs, etc.

As package grows:
- find conferences, summer schools, online conferences to present at
- start regular (e.g., quarterly) user meetings
- host meetings / workshops for users
