# Documentation

Two decisions need to be made: generator and host. We'll use [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) (instead of sphinx) for generator and [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/) (instead of github pages) for host.

Rationale:
- MkDocs supports markdown out-of-the-box, which is much better than ReST
- readthedocs supports building documentation for PRs, which is very helpful.
